<h1>RoboControl</h1>
Robo Control is an App used to wirelessly controll a robot. You control it either through a virtual joystick or by use of the Gesture Control bracelet MYO made by Thalmic Labs.
 
To use Robo Control to handle a robot, the smartphone has to be connected to the WiFi-Network generated by, for example, an XBeeÂ® WiFi-Module made by Digi International.
If a valid connection is established, Robo Control sends relevant data, which will be analized and processed by a microprocessor, to the WiFi-Module up to ten times each second.
To use MYO for controlling the robot, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is required.

<h4>Install</h4>
1. Download the current version from either the APK folder or Dropbox (see "Links").
2. Make sure to activate the option "Allow unknown sources" on your Android smartphone.
   <p>To get to the settings for unknown sources, open your your settings and select either "Application" or "Security" (depending on your device), where you can check or uncheck "Unknown Sources".</p>
3. Install RoboControl

<h4>First Steps</h4>

1. connect WiFi<br>
	Connect your smartphone to the WiFi-Module.

	Robo Control -> WiFi Settings<br>
	or<br>
	Settings (Smartphone) -> Wi-Fi
	
2. pair MYO<br>

The App was programmed with Eclipse adn the (outdated) ADT Plugin. To import the App to Eclipse, both projects have to be imported from libs/Library.zip first. After that RoboControl can be imported. The libraries may have to be reassigned.
